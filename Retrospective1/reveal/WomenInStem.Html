                    <p>After decades of hard work to promote young people's interest in the <abbr title="Science Technology Engineering and Math">STEM</abbr> subjects, it is exciting to note that women are leading the way in STEM fields. Women now make up 56% of undergraduate students, and they are taking the world by storm in STEM fields ranging from genetics to gaming.<aside>
                            Women's participation in STEM fields could spur economic growth and promote gender equality worldwide.

                    <h3>Obstacles for Women in STEM</h3>
                    
                    <p>There are plenty of barriers for women seeking STEM careers. One of the biggest obstacles begins at birth, with gender stereotypes subtly steering girls toward "softer" subjects like social sciences and the humanities from a very early age. By the time they reach school, this snowballs into a lack of confidence in their STEM skills, which in turn can lead to lower performance—a gap that only widens as girls get older.
                    To address this issue, girls must be exposed to STEM based projects in classrooms. Academia and private institutions need to actively diversify their STEM hiring and promote talented women to positions of leadership. They should let young girls meet women role models in STEM field and will encourage them.</p>
                    <h3>Seven Outstanding Women in STEM</h3>

                    <p>Given the serious barriers that women face, it's important to celebrate the women who challenge the stereotypes and rise to the top of their STEM fields. Doing so can provide inspiration for girls and boys alike. </p>
